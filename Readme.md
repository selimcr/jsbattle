1. Start the server using `npm start`
1. Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to see the battle.

## Create your own tank

1. To start the programing of your tank you can copy/paste any of the sample tanks at `src/tanks` folder with a name like `{name}.tank.js` where the `{name}` section will be the name that you will use to load your tank into battle.
1. Read the documentation to understand how the tank work and different ways to program your logic [here](https://jsbattle.jmrlab.com/docs/).
1. Start coding!!!

## Test your tank

1. The list of the tanks in the battle is defined at `index.html` file with `const tanks = ['chicken', 'crawler', 'crazy', 'dodge', 'dummy', 'kamikaze', 'sniper', 'test'];`
1. To try your own tank just included it in the list with the `{name}` that you use.
1. You can try it VS all the demo tanks or maybe just list 1 or 2, that's your call!!!
1. Restart or refresh the browser to see your tank in action.

## Push your tank

1. When your tank is ready for battle you can push it to the repo.
1. If you don't want that others see your logic very easy feel free to obfuscate your code and pushed a versionof the js file with the obfuscate code, you can use https://obfuscator.io/ to do it.
